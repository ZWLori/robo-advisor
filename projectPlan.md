# Robo-advisor project plan

## To-do list (for week1~2)

### Content development
- Conversational scripts (Yihan + Cuimin)
	- Scripts during orientation
	- Scripts during main experiment

- Consistent UI design (TBA)


### Structure design 
- Google cloud set up (wanlu) or x10host
- Orientation (Wanlu)
	- Input style
		- Name: it's a choice, not fill_in_the_blank
		- Avatar of robots: using three sample avatars (under /images folder) instead of uploading
- Revise the parameters of robo-advisor's past performance based on Yihan's simulation of historical results (refer to the file performance_parameters.R, section 8) - Wanlu

### Debugging
- The condition assignment needs to be consistent, e.g. those randomly assigned to high performance during demo stage shall also be assigned to high performance during main experiment (wanlu)


### Feature refinement (ranked by priority)
- Design several styles of avatar for robo-advisor (by graphic designer)

- The conversation of robo-advisor needs to be accompanied with the corresponding avatar (Wanlu)

- Demo showcase
	- Replace the slider with a pie chart to make it more intuitive to understand (illustrated in ppt, feature refinement section) (graphic designer/wanlu)

- Main experiment
	- Time interval, 12 months instead of 24  

### Timeline

## Have-done list
- Re-classify robo-advisor's financial performance based on S&P 500 or other widely recognised benchmarks (Yihan) (✓)

- To add two sub-stages (Wanlu) (✓)

		1. Manipulation check stage (✓)

The purpose of manipulation check is to validate that participants can correctly evaluate robo-advisor's financial performance

		2. Final evaluation stage (✓)
	
The purpose of final evaluation is to solicit participants' opinions of robo-advisor after substantial interaction

- To make a mock-up version with all stages (Wanlu) (✓)

- Manipulation check and final evaluation (Yihan)
	- Survey question for manipulation (✓)
	- Survey question for final evaluation(✓)
